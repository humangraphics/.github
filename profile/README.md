# Welcome to HumanGraphics

Hi there! üëã Welcome to the official GitHub organization for [**HumanGraphics**](https://www.humangraphics.io/). We're thrilled to have you here!

At HumanGraphics, we're dedicated to revolutionizing how people interact with demographic data through our cutting-edge API services. Our mission is to provide seamless, efficient, and scalable solutions that empower developers, businesses, and researchers to append demographic estimates to names, locations, photos, and social profiles with ease.

## What We Do

At the core of HumanGraphics, we develop APIs that:

- **Append Demographic Estimates:** Enhance your datasets with valuable demographic insights.
- **To Whatever Data you Have:** From names and locations to photos and social profiles.
- **That Promote Data-Driven Decisions:** Empower your applications with data that matters.

## Our Technology

Our platform is built on a **serverless architecture**, leveraging the power and flexibility of AWS to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance. By going serverless, we've minimized operational overhead while maximizing the ability to innovate rapidly.

### Why Serverless?

- **Scalability:** Automatically scales with our demand, ensuring our APIs are always available when you need them.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** With a pay-as-you-go model, we keep our costs down and pass those savings on to you.
- **Rapid Deployment:** We can quickly update and deploy new features, keeping our product on the cutting edge.

### Exploring HumanGraphics' Serverless Architecture

Our team presented about HumanGraphics' journey to serverless architecture on [**Serverless Land**](https://serverlessland.com/). The talk was a deep dive into the business and technology challenges we faced, the solutions we implemented, and the lessons we learned along the way. Viewers might be particularly interested in the [open-sourced Lambda layer](https://github.com/humangraphics/backend-lambda-layer) that allows HumanGraphics to host AI and ML models in AWS Lambda with minimal cold start times!
